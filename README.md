This work presents a formal operational semantics for named barriers and defines what it means for a warp- specialized kernel to be correct. It considers the higher performance, but more complex, warp-specialized kernels in GPUâ€™s based on producer-consumer named barriers.Algorithms(Sound and Complete) are proposed for verifying the correctness of warp-specialized kernels. WEFT, a verification tool for checking warp-specialized code is also presented.
